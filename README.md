## YoutubeReVanced
Besides enjoying videos freely and without restriction, YouTube Vanced allows you to enjoy them in the background. Thanks to this feature, you can still watch the videos you are watching when you exit the application. You can both review the videos and chat with your friends through them. The application also supports playback of those videos again if you have a need. This feature is highly convenient, allowing you to enjoy videos and access freely or do other tasks simultaneously right on the playing device.
